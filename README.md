# 🎾 Tennis Tournament API 🚀
This is the unofficial API for retrieving relevant tournament data of tennis tournaments in Germany.

⚠️ NOTE: The API is currently under active development!

## ⚙️ How It Works

## 📖 How to Use

## 💡 Motivation 💡
🔍 The current platforms for searching tournaments lack efficiency and have poor usability.
❌ They lack key features like notifications, advanced filtering, and a better UI.
💡 This inspired me to build my own tournament platform with better functionality.
🛠️ To achieve this, I first need reliable tournament data, so I am developing this API as the backbone for future projects.
