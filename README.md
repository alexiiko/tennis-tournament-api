# 🎾 Tennis Tournament API 🚀
This is the unofficial API for retrieving relevant tournament data of tennis tournaments in Germany.

> [!WARNING]
> The API is under active development and may be buggy.

## ⚙️ How It Works
...

## 📖 How to Use
1. Open a directory.
2. Run `python -m venv .` in the directory.
3. Clone the repository into the directory.
4. Run `pip install -r src/requirements.txt`.
5. Run the main file with `python data_getter.py`.
> [!CAUTION]
> When running there is a possibility that the coordinates of the elements don't align with your screen. This could lead into pressing `enter` at the wrong time.

## 💡 Motivation 💡
🔍 The current platforms for searching tournaments lack efficiency and have poor usability.  
❌ They lack key features like notifications, advanced filtering, and a better UI.  
💡 This inspired me to build my own tournament platform with better functionality.  
🛠️ To achieve this, I first need reliable tournament data, so I am developing this API as the backbone for future projects.
